# Customization Guide

How to adapt the template for a specific merchant. Work through these in order.

## 1. Copy the Template

```bash
cp .claude/skills/demo-deck-builder/references/template.html merchants/[merchant-slug]/demo-deck.html
```

Use kebab-case for the merchant slug (e.g., `pdi`, `transferflow`, `arlington-industries`).

## 2. Update Title and Watermark

**In `<head>`**:
```html
<title>Shopify × [Merchant] — [Deal Type] Demo</title>
```

**In the watermark** (top-left corner):
```html
<span class="pdi-text">[MERCHANT]</span>
```

The class is named `pdi-text` historically — don't rename, just replace the inner text.

## 3. Embed the Merchant Logo

If `merchants/[slug]/[name]_logo.png` exists:

```python
# One-liner to base64 encode
import base64
with open("merchants/[slug]/[name]_logo.png", "rb") as f:
    b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()
print(f'data:image/png;base64,{b64}')
```

Then in the cover slide, replace the `.pdi-logo` text div with an `<img>` tag:

```html
<img class="pdi-logo-img" src="data:image/png;base64,...long string..." alt="Merchant">
```

If **no logo is available**, use a text treatment:

```html
<div class="pdi-logo" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #COLOR1 0%, #COLOR2 100%);">MERCHANT</div>
```

Pick two brand colors from the merchant's website for the gradient.

Also add the logo to the watermark for a subtle brand presence there:

```html
<img class="pdi-watermark-img" src="data:image/png;base64,...same base64..." alt="Merchant">
```

## 4. Set the Color Palette

Default is healthcare teal. To swap, edit the `:root` CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` block:

```css
:root {
  --bg: #0a1420;              /* Dark background - usually keep */
  --bg-elevated: #0f1a28;
  --surface: #14202e;
  --surface-hover: #1a2938;
  --border: #233345;
  --text: #e6edf3;
  --accent: #14a098;           /* Primary brand color */
  --accent-bright: #1cc7bd;    /* Gradient partner */
  --accent-dim: rgba(20, 160, 152, 0.12);
  --accent-glow: rgba(20, 160, 152, 0.4);
  --accent-border: rgba(20, 160, 152, 0.35);
  --navy: #1e3a5f;             /* Secondary accent */
}
```

### Palette Recipes

**Healthcare** (default): teal `#14a098` + navy `#1e3a5f`
**Technology**: electric blue `#3b82f6` + purple `#8b5cf6`
**Industrial**: amber `#f59e0b` + deep red `#991b1b`
**Food/Beverage**: warm orange `#ea580c` + olive `#65a30d`
**Fashion**: rose `#e11d48` + plum `#701a75`
**Finance**: emerald `#059669` + slate `#475569`

Always keep the dark background (`--bg: #0a1420` or similar) — the light effects depend on it.

## 5. Set Speaker Names

For every slide, add `data-speaker="FirstName"`:

```html
<section class="slide" data-speaker="Zach">
```

- **AE** presents opening slides (Cover, Recap, About Shopify, Customer Proof, Pricing, Closing)
- **SE** presents technical/demo slides (everything in between)

Read `personal-config.md` for the SE name if it's the user. Ask for the AE name if not in context.

## 6. Tailor Content to the Merchant

### Opening (AE-led)

- **Cover**: `[Deal Type] Commerce` eyebrow, headline hook tailored to the merchant's transformation story
- **Recap**: Pull from their `briefing-document.md` or most recent meeting notes. Split into "Confirmed" and "In motion" columns
- **About Shopify**: Keep generic stats (5M+ merchants, $292B GMV, etc.) — this slide is boilerplate
- **B2B Evolution timeline**: Only include if the deal is B2B or hybrid
- **Customer Proof**: Pick 6 brands in the merchant's industry who run on Shopify. Avoid competitors they're already aware of.

### Modern Commerce Platform (SE-led)

- **Agentic Commerce (Gemini)**: Write a realistic D2C buyer scenario using the merchant's actual product line
- **Sidekick**: Operational questions the merchant's team would actually ask (inventory, marketing, analytics)

### Buyer Journeys (SE-led)

Feature slides should reflect the merchant's **actual use cases** from discovery:
- Does the merchant sell DTC? → include DTC journey slides
- Does the merchant have a B2B portal? → include B2B journey + contract pricing slides
- Does the merchant have sales reps? → include Sales Rep slide. **Otherwise skip it.**
- Does the merchant sell variants (size, pack, color)? → include variants slide
- Does the merchant need multi-warehouse? → include allocation slide
- Does the merchant drop-ship? → include drop-ship slide

**Rule**: if it wasn't in discovery, don't include it. Better to have 5 relevant slides than 12 generic ones.

### Operations & Integration (SE-led)

Tailor based on the merchant's actual stack:
- ERP they use (D365, NetSuite, SAP, Sage, Oracle, etc.) — name it on the integration slide
- 3PL needs (or acknowledge they self-fulfill)
- EDI partners (for B2B distributors)
- Marketing stack they have or want

### Close (AE-led)

- **Three Anchors**: Pick the 3 most compelling outcomes for *this* merchant. Write descriptions that reference their specific business context.
- **Pricing**: Shopify Plus pricing — `$2,300/mo` 3-year / `$2,500/mo` 1-year. VPF `0.35%` DTC / `0.18%` B2B / `0.25%` retail. Include any merchant-specific math (e.g., ACH savings).
- **Closing**: 3 concrete next steps — usually "review partner intros", "scope integration requirements", "confirm rollout plan"

## 7. Chat Scenarios

### Gemini D2C Scenario

Pick the merchant's hero consumer product. Write a scenario where someone Googles/asks AI for their specific need. Format:

> *"[Role/situation]. [Specific need or constraint]. [Preference]?"*

Example: *"I'm a nurse on 12-hour shifts. My hands are cracked from constant sanitizing. What's a good moisturizing antimicrobial hand wipe I can throw in my bag?"*

### Sidekick Operations Scenario

Pick something the merchant's small team would actually ask. Format:

> *"[Operational question about the store]"*

Example: *"Which products are running low on inventory this week?"* (followed by the action buttons)

## 8. Final Checks

Before handing off:

- [ ] Open in Chrome, walk through every slide with arrow keys
- [ ] Gemini chat animates on its slide (no earlier)
- [ ] Sidekick chat animates on its slide
- [ ] Nav dots respond to clicks
- [ ] Speaker tag toggles between AE and SE names
- [ ] No content is cut off at smaller screen sizes
- [ ] Merchant logo renders (both cover and watermark)
- [ ] All inline strong/bold text renders correctly
- [ ] File size under 300KB (for quick site upload)

## 9. Optional: Deploy to Quick Site

If the user wants the deck hosted:

1. Rename `demo-deck.html` → `index.html`
2. Run `quick init [merchant]-demo` in the merchant folder
3. Follow `quick deploy` prompts
4. Shareable URL: `https://[merchant]-demo.quick.shopify.io/`

Otherwise just open the HTML locally from Chrome and present fullscreen (`F` key).
