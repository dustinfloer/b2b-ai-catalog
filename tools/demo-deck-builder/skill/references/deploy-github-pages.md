# Deploy Deck to Password-Protected GitHub Pages

A merchant-safe share path: encrypted HTML behind a password, hosted on GitHub Pages, reachable via a public URL.

**Why this pattern:**
- Quick sites at `*.quick.shopify.io` are IAP-gated — Shopify employees only. Merchants can't open them.
- Emailing a raw HTML file feels amateur and some email filters strip it.
- Public GitHub exposes merchant-specific content in search results.
- Encrypted GitHub Pages solves all three: clean URL, private content, no Shopify-auth dependency.

**How it works:**
1. `staticrypt` encrypts the deck's HTML with AES-256 using a user-chosen password.
2. Encrypted HTML is pushed to a public GitHub repo.
3. GitHub Pages serves it at `https://[user].github.io/[repo]/`.
4. Merchant loads the URL → sees password prompt → enters password → content decrypts in the browser.

The content is cryptographically unreadable in source until the password is entered. Password + URL must both leak for the content to be exposed.

## Prerequisites (check before starting)

```bash
gh auth status                              # must be logged in with `repo` scope
gh api user --jq '.login'                   # returns user's GitHub handle (save this)
which pnpx || which npx                     # pnpx preferred; npx falls back
```

If `gh` isn't authenticated: tell the user to run `gh auth login` before proceeding.

If neither `pnpx` nor `npx` is available: tell the user to install `pnpm` or `npm` first.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1 — Collect inputs

Ask the user (via AskUserQuestion when possible):

1. **Password** — suggest 2-3 options based on context (e.g., `acme2026`, `shopify-demo`, `{partner-name}-demo`). Keep short and memorable — the merchant will type this on mobile.
2. **Repo name** — suggest `[merchant-slug]-demo-deck`. Confirm they're happy with the repo name appearing in the URL.

### Step 2 — Set up `.deploy/` working directory

Create `merchants/[merchant]/.deploy/`. This directory:
- Is a git repo of its own (separate from the SE-Assistant repo)
- Holds the encrypted `index.html` (what GitHub Pages serves)
- Contains the `redeploy.sh` helper for future updates
- Tracks a `.last-source-hash` file for idempotent redeploys

### Step 3 — Copy + encrypt the deck

```bash
cd merchants/[merchant]/.deploy
cp ../index.html index.html
pnpx staticrypt index.html -p "[password]" --short -d . \
  --template-title "[merchant] × Shopify Plus" \
  --template-instructions "Enter the password shared with you to view this deck." \
  --template-color-primary "#14a098" \
  --template-color-secondary "#0a1420" \
  --template-button "Unlock"
```

The encrypted output overwrites `.deploy/index.html`. A `.staticrypt.json` is also written (contains salt, not the password).

### Step 4 — Initialize git + create README

```bash
git init -b main
cat > README.md <<'EOF'
# [Merchant] × Shopify Plus — Demo Deck

Password-protected presentation. Contact the presenter for access.
EOF
git config user.email "[user's shopify email]"
git config user.name "[user's full name]"
git add index.html README.md
git commit -m "Initial deck"
```

### Step 5 — Create the GitHub repo + push

```bash
gh repo create [repo-name] \
  --public \
  --description "Shopify Plus demo deck for [Merchant] (password-protected)" \
  --source=. --push
```

**Public is required for GitHub Pages on free tier.** That's fine — the content is encrypted.

### Step 6 — Enable GitHub Pages

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/[user]/[repo-name]/pages \
  -f "source[branch]=main" \
  -f "source[path]=/"
```

### Step 7 — Wait for the first build (30-90 seconds)

```bash
# Poll until status = "built"
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
  sleep 15
  deploy_state=$(gh api repos/[user]/[repo-name]/pages --jq '.status')
  echo "Poll $i: $deploy_state"
  [ "$deploy_state" = "built" ] && break
done
curl -sI https://[user].github.io/[repo-name]/ | head -1     # should return 200
```

### Step 8 — Install the redeploy helper

Copy `references/redeploy.sh.template` to `.deploy/redeploy.sh`, substituting the placeholders:
- `{{SOURCE_HTML}}` → `../index.html`
- `{{PASSWORD}}` → user's chosen password
- `{{DECK_TITLE}}` → `[Merchant] × Shopify Plus`
- `{{LIVE_URL}}` → `https://[user].github.io/[repo-name]/`

```bash
chmod +x .deploy/redeploy.sh
```

### Step 9 — Commit the redeploy helper to the deploy repo

```bash
cd .deploy
git add redeploy.sh
git commit -m "Add redeploy helper"
git push
```

### Step 10 — Return success summary to the user

Give them:
- **The URL** — `https://[user].github.io/[repo-name]/`
- **The password** — chosen in Step 1
- **A draft email** they can send to the merchant (short, professional, uses their AE/SE name)
- **How to redeploy** — `cd merchants/[merchant]/.deploy && ./redeploy.sh`

Format the email as a copy-paste block. Reference specific slides the merchant should revisit (pricing, integration, timeline — whatever the deck emphasized).

## Failure modes and handling

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `gh repo create` fails with 403 | Token missing `repo` scope | User runs `gh auth refresh -s repo` |
| `gh api ... /pages` returns 404 | Repo not fully propagated yet | Sleep 5 sec, retry once |
| Pages build status stuck at `null` or `building` for >5 min | GitHub service issue or `index.html` at wrong path | Check `gh api repos/[user]/[repo]/pages/builds` for error |
| Curl returns 404 after deploy | Wrong source path (should be `/`, not `/docs`) | Re-POST pages config with correct source |
| `pnpx staticrypt` fails | `pnpm` not installed or npx context error | Fall back to `npx staticrypt` |

---

## Redeploy behavior (what `./redeploy.sh` does on subsequent runs)

1. Hashes the source `../index.html`
2. Compares against `.last-source-hash`
3. If unchanged → exits with "Nothing to do"
4. If changed → re-encrypts, commits with timestamped message, pushes, saves new hash
5. `--force` flag bypasses the hash check (useful for rotating the salt/password)

This prevents noisy no-op commits when the user runs the script without having edited the deck.

---

## When NOT to use this path

- **If the merchant's buyer is @shopify.com** (e.g., internal demo) → use a quick site, not GitHub Pages
- **If the content has any `[INTERNAL-ONLY]` markers** → do not publish, even encrypted. Internal content stays internal.
- **If the merchant has explicit data-handling requirements** prohibiting external hosting → email the HTML file or use the merchant's approved share mechanism

Always check merchant-specific compliance constraints in `merchants/[merchant]/briefing-document.md` before publishing.
